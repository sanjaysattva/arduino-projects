## ESP32 Web Server :

***Creating  a standalone web server with an ESP32 that controls outputs (two LEDs) using the Arduino IDE programming environment.*** 

## Project outline: 
1) The web server youâ€™ll build controls two LEDs connected to the ESP32 GPIO 26 and GPIO 27;


2) You can access the ESP32 web server by typing the ESP32 IP address on a browser in the local network;


3) By clicking the buttons on your web server you can instantly change the state of each LED.
